As t-tests were initially designed to do simple A/B testing comparing two groups of the same sample to identify whether or not the two groups are different enough to warrant further investigation, I believe it works very well for our purposes here. ***CITE***"

As vitamin D levels have been associated with immune support, among other benefits, it's plausible that for some patients higher levels of vitamin D may be associated with shorter hospitalizations. \n",

However, we'll plot the distributions anyway and see what the data look like."
